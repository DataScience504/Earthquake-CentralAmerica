# Earthquake Visualization in Central America (1975–2025)

This project provides an interactive, visual exploration of **earthquake activity in Central America** over the last 50 years. Using data visualization tools like **Folium** and **Pandas**, we identify spatial patterns, seismic hotspots, and the most powerful earthquakes in the region.

## 📌 Highlights

- 🔥 **Heatmap** of earthquakes with magnitude ≥ 5.0
- 📍 **Top 10 strongest earthquakes** with numbered red-circle markers
- 🗺️ Fully interactive **Leaflet-based maps** via `Folium`

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Folium
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files Included

- `EarthquakeCA.ipynb`: Main analysis and visualizations
- `Top10_Earthquakes.html`: Interactive map of top 10 strongest events (Please download map to see)
