# Earthquake Visualization in Central America (1975‚Äì2025)

This project provides an interactive, visual exploration of **earthquake activity in Central America** over the last 50 years. Using data visualization tools like **Folium** and **Pandas**, we identify spatial patterns, seismic hotspots, and the most powerful earthquakes in the region.

## üìå Highlights

- üî• **Heatmap** of earthquakes with magnitude ‚â• 5.0
- üìç **Top 10 strongest earthquakes** with numbered red-circle markers
- üó∫Ô∏è Fully interactive **Leaflet-based maps** via `Folium`

## üß™ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Folium
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## üìÅ Files Included

- `EarthquakeCA.ipynb`: Main analysis and visualizations
- `Top10_Earthquakes.html`: Interactive map of top 10 strongest events
- `earthquake_map.html`: Heatmap of all significant earthquakes

## üîé Data Source

Earthquake data was obtained from the [USGS Earthquake Hazards Program](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) and filtered for Central America between 1975 and July 2025.
